# Simulating-Ball-Physics

<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>This is one of many projects I am making for my MIT programming course.
This was an early assignment to teach some fundamentals about moving div objects on the screen with javascript</p>

<h2>Installation: </h2>
<p>After installing all you have to do is run the program, it should open your default browser and run automatically.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Changes: </h2>
<p>This was adapted from an earlier project that only moved left and right.
I followed up by adding up and down movement.
To finish the project completely, I also made it so when the ball collided it would change colors.</p>
